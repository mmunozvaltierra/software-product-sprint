      <p>This is my portfolio.</p>
      <img src="/images/profPortrait.jpg">
      <p>My name is Mauricio Munoz. I am a second year computer science major at UC Santa Barbara excited to participate
         in SPS to gain experience, learn as much as I can about web development and network with my peers. I was born in
         Mexico, but I moved to California when I was 3. Currently, I spend my time inside my apartment in Goleta, CA. In 
         my free time I like to play video games and sports. I also enjoy lifting weights. I love dogs and my dream dog is
         a Golden Retriever which I plan on getting once I graduate! A fun fact about me is that I have never broken a bone.
