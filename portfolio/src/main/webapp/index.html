      <h2>About Me!</h2>
      <p>My name is Mauricio Munoz. I am a second year computer science major at UC Santa Barbara excited to participate
         in SPS to gain experience, learn as much as I can about web development and network with my peers. I was born in
         Aguascalientes, Mexico, but I moved to California when I was 3. I have lived in Montclair previously and currently
         in Bloomington,CA which is not a well known city. Currently, I spend my time inside my college apartment in Goleta, CA.
         In my free time I like to play video games and sports. I also enjoy lifting weights. I love dogs and my dream dog is
         a Golden Retriever which I plan on getting once I graduate! A fun fact about me is that I have never broken a bone.
