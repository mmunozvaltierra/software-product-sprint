      <h2 class="section-title">About Me!</h2>
      <p class="content-text">My name is Mauricio Munoz. I am a second year computer science major at UC Santa Barbara and am currently an 
         undergraduate research intern @ UCSB Quantum Foundry Lab.
      </p>
      <p class="content-text"> I was born in Aguascalientes, Mexico, but I moved to California when I was 3. I have lived in Montclair previously and currently
         in Bloomington, CA which is not a well known city. Currently, I spend my time inside my college apartment in Goleta, CA.
         I love dogs and my dream dog is a Golden Retriever which I plan on getting once I graduate! A fun fact about me is that I have 
         never broken a bone.

                   I loved Star Wars as a kid and I have once again started to get interested once again. I loved the first six movies
                   and have mixed emotions on the final 3. My favorite character is Captain Rex. Lego Star Wars sets has also carried on
                   from my childhood. My dream has been to build a Lego Death Star since I was a kid and I hope to some day accomplish it.

            <li><h4 class="title-text">Sports</h4>
                <p class="content-text">
                    I love playing sports! I am always up for a challenge and love to win! My favorite sport is baseball. I started playing baseball when
                    I was in elementary school and continued playing until I graduated high school. Now I am limited with school and only have time to play
                    catch with my friends. If you are interested in performance, I topped out on the mound at 85 mph my senior year of high school where I pitched
                    and played 3rd base. Not the best, but some players definitely had trouble catching up to it.
